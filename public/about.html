<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shady Ernest and I am a Junior Web Developer, I'm 21 years old with a passion of gaming and eating, mostly asian ramen
  noodles, I live in Cairo, Egypt, yes you might say I am a poor person due to the country's economic state at the moment, but I am
  from a mid - income family that strives to help me finish my education, so I am practically happy with my current life, I am Diagnosed
  with ADHD and high cholestrol (Genetic) but that doesn't block my path of education nor life</p>

  <p>I study Business Information Systems in the Arab Academy of Science, Techology & Maritime Transport in Cairo with a GPA score of
    3.95, before I had chosen this major I was considering Computer Engineering at first, but due to it's difficulty and fees, I thought
    twice about it and enrolled into the latter and I never regretted it, Studying isn't the best part in my life as everyone is, but
    I'm passionate about being a developer whether it's creating a website, managing databases or creating a video game which is not
    in major I'm studying in but I love video games overall</p>

    <p>My hobbies, well it's kind of a mess and I currently don't have a hobby besides gaming at this point, I used to play squash,
      got bored and played swimming, also got bored of that and played tennis, also got bored of it and decided to give up on playing
      sports, now I often go to the gym if I have the time to do so, now my life consists of eating, gaming and studying, maybe watch
      a soccer match with my father, I rarely hangout with some of my friends due to them being lazy (like me), and that's pretty much
      it.</p>
